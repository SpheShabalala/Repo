The automation test scripts are created using Cypress.
To run the scripts open your IDE, then open Cypress by running command npm run cypress:open. Cypress should open up if configuration was done correctly. Select E2E Testing (configure if not done yet) then choose a broswer for testing.
Under Specs, locate the name test script is saved as and click on it, the test will run and show the results.
